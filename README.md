# CHIKV-Effective-Strategies
Effective strategies to control the largest chikungunya fever outbreak in China

The projecet primary analyzes the effective strategies to control the largest chikungunya fever outbreak in China, including three main files: (1) data, (2) code, and (3) result.
In the first file (named data), it contains the data required for the manuscript (named Foshan_cases.xlsx). The first sheet is the data for simulation fitting (Sheet1), and the second sheet is the data for model validation (Sheet2).
In the code file, it contains the following:
    1.Data fitting (named "1.fitted-foshan_k")
    2.Rt calculation ("2.calculate Rt")
    3.Simulation of the effects of different interventions ("3.simulate_foshan_combind_measures")
    4.Results and visualization of different intervention combinations ("4.combind_measures_result")
    5.Validation ("5.validation_combind_measures_result")
    6.Simulation of the vector clearance rate under different interventions ("6.simulate_foshan_single_measure_calculate_mosquitoes")
The results file is used to store the results of data analysis and visualization.
